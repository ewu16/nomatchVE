}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing pertinent information for VE estimation.}

\item{outcome_name}{Character string specifying the name of the outcome
variable in \code{data}. Outcome variable should be a numeric representing follow-up time relative to study
start d0.}

\item{event_name}{Character string specifying the name of the event indicator
variable in \code{data}. Event indicator should be numeric-valued: 1=event, 0=censored.}

\item{trt_name}{Character string specifying name of the vaccination indicator
variable in \code{data}. Vaccination indicator is an indicator of ever receiving vaccine during the
follow-up period and should be numeric-valued: 1=yes, 0 = no.}

\item{time_name}{Character string specifying name of the vaccination time
variable in \code{data}. Vaccination time should be NA if never received vaccine
during follow-up.}

\item{adjust_vars}{A character vector containing the names of variables in
\code{data} to adjust for.}

\item{marginalizing_dist}{Character string describing the type of estimated
day/covariate distributions to marginalize over. Values are "observed" or
"matched". Alternatively, for pre-specified marginalizing distributions can
be a list of 2 dataframes named \code{g_dist} and \code{p_dist}.}

\item{t0}{The time (relative to time of vaccination) at which to return
cumulative incidence estimates.}

\item{censor_time}{The time at which vaccinated individuals are censored during model fitting.
If interested in multiple timepoints, recommended to set this to the maximum timepoint of interest
and then using \code{\link[=timepoints]{timepoints()}}.}

\item{tau}{The time excluded after vaccination to allow building up of
immunity}

\item{boot_formula_0}{A formula for estimating hazards in
unvaccinated group for bootstrap samples (not a model)}

\item{boot_formula_1}{A formula for estimating hazards in
vaccinated group for bootstrap samples (not a model)}

\item{matched_data}{A data frame representing the matched cohort}

\item{gp_list}{List of two dataframes named \code{g_dist} and \code{p_dist} representing
the marginalizing distributions to use.}

\item{limit_type}{Character string indicating whether the marginalizing
distributions of interest are the estimated distributions in the "limit"
or "fixed" sense. For a prespecified marginalizing_dist, limit_type is
always fixed.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing point estimates for
\verb{psi_bar_0, psi_bar_1, ve} in the bootstrapped sample
}
\description{
This function creates a bootstrapped sample and computes the
corresponding point estimate
}
