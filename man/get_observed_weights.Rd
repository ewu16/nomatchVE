\title{Estimate marginalizing weights from observed data}
\usage{
get_observed_weights(data, outcome_name, trt_name, time_name, adjust_vars, tau)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome_name}{Name of the possibly-censored time-to-event variable, measured from the chosen time origin.}

\item{trt_name}{Name of the exposure indicator. The underlying column should be numeric
(\code{1} = exposed during follow-up, \code{0} = never exposed during follow-up). Exposure indicator
should indicate whether an individual is exposed while uncensored and before experiencing the endpoint of interest.}

\item{time_name}{Name of the time to exposure, measured from the chosen time origin; use \code{NA} if not exposed.}

\item{adjust_vars}{Character vector of baseline covariates to adjust for when fitting the hazard models.}

\item{tau}{Numeric. Only vaccinated who are at-risk tau days after vaccination are included.}
}
\description{
Computes empirical probability distributions g(d|x) and P(x) from
vaccinated individuals who remain at risk tau days post-vaccination.

Most users don't need to call this directly - \code{\link[=nomatchVE]{nomatchVE()}} handles
it automatically. This function can be used for
\itemize{
\item Creating custom marginalizing distributions
\item Diagnosing estimation issues
\item Comparing different target populations
}

# Advanced: Create distributions manually
