\arguments{
\item{matched_data}{A data frame for the matched cohort}

\item{outcome_name}{Name of the possibly-censored time-to-event variable, measured from the chosen time origin.}

\item{event_name}{Name of the event indicator. The underlying column should be numeric
(\code{1} = event, \code{0} = censored).}

\item{trt_name}{Name of the exposure indicator. The underlying column should be numeric
(\code{1} = exposed during follow-up, \code{0} = never exposed during follow-up). Exposure indicator
should indicate whether an individual is exposed while uncensored and before experiencing the endpoint of interest.}

\item{time_name}{Name of the time to exposure, measured from the chosen time origin; use \code{NA} if not exposed.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying method for survival estimation ("cox" for
Cox proportional hazards regression model or "km" for Kaplan-Meier estimation)}

\item{adjust}{If \code{method = "cox"}, a formula or  character vector containing the names of covariates in
\code{matched_data} to adjust for.}

\item{separate}{If \code{method = cox} and \code{separate = TRUE}, Cox regression models are fit in the treated and untreated groups separately.}

\item{times}{Numeric vector of time after exposure at which to evaluate VE. All values must be greater than tau and
should reflect meaningful clinical timepoints (e.g., 30, 60, 90 days).}

\item{censor_time}{Time after exposure at which exposed
individuals are administratively censored during model fitting. Default:
\code{max(times)}. This is used to limit borrowing of information from beyond the time period of interest.}

\item{tau}{Time after exposure (vaccination)  to exclude as part of an "immune build-up" period. Must be non-negative.
Common values may include 0 days (no delay), 7 days (one week), 14 days (two weeks) and should
match the biological understanding of when vaccine-induced immunity develops.}

\item{confint_type}{Method for constructing confidence intervals.
One of \code{"wald"}, \code{"percentile"}, or \code{"both"}.
\itemize{
\item \code{"wald"}: Computes Wald-style intervals using bootstrap standard errors.
\item \code{"percentile"}: Computes percentile bootstrap intervals.
\item \code{"both"}: Computes and returns both sets of intervals.
Default: \code{"wald"}. See \strong{Confidence intervals} section.
}}

\item{n_boot}{Number of bootstrap replicates for confidence intervals.
Recommended to use at least 1000 for publication-quality results. Use smaller values (e.g., 10-100) for initial exploration.
Default: \code{0} (no bootstrapping).}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for confidence intervals (Confidence level = 100*(1-\code{alpha})\%). Default: \code{0.05}.}

\item{limit_type}{The default value is \code{limit_type = "fixed"}, wherein bootstrap samples are formed from the
original matched data set. If `limit_type = "limit", the matching procedure is performed in each
bootstrap iteration.}

\item{data}{If \code{limit_type = "limit"}, the original data used to constructed the matched cohort}

\item{id_name}{If \code{limit_type = "limit"}, character string representing the individual identifier variable  in \code{data}}

\item{matching_vars}{If \code{limit_type = "limit"}, a character vector containing the names of variables in \code{data} to match on.}

\item{replace}{If \code{limit_type = "limit"}, logical: Should matching be done with replacement?}

\item{return_models}{Logical; return fitted conditional hazard models?
Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{return_boot}{Logical; return bootstrap draws in \code{boot_samples}?
Default: \code{TRUE}. Must be set to \code{TRUE} if user plans to use \code{\link[=add_simultaneous_ci]{add_simultaneous_ci()}}
to obtain simultaneous confidence intervals.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer; parallel cores for bootstrapping. Passed to
\code{parallel::mclapply} as \code{mc.cores}. On Unix-like OS only; not available on
Windows. Default: \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following:
\describe{
\item{estimates}{A list of matrices of the estimates at each timepoint. Rows of
each matrix are the terms "cuminc_0", "cuminc_1", "ve". Columns of each matrix
gives the point estimate and confidence intervals at the specified time point.}
\item{times}{The timepoints at which VE was evaluated}
\item{n_success_boot}{A numeric vector of the number of successful bootstrap samples for each time point.(Success bootstrap samples are
those that result in non-missing valid point estimates.)}
\item{boot_samples}{If \code{return_boot = TRUE}, a list of matrices for each term that contain the bootstrap estimates where the rows are the bootstrap iterations and
the columns are the time points.}
